# KH2Japanese

Makes KH2FM from the 1.5 + 2.5 collection as close to the original Kingdom Hearts 2 Japanese release as possible. Stil a WIP. 

Biggest thing would be JP Trinity bug. Its not a simple as all the other changes.

Not removing the FM areas so you can do those if you wish. Limit Form and Two Become One are in chests in the first room of CoR. The original popups aren't removed due to crashing instead they give Dummy 13.

Please let me know of anything I may have missed. Biggest things im unsure of is if Boss/Enemy AI and/or Animations chaged.

Bosses changed/reverted so far are:
- Luxord
- Xemnas 1
- Armored Xemnas 2
- Final Xemnas

Animtaitons changed/reverted so far are:
- Quick Run
