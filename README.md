# KH2Japanese

Makes KH2FM from the 1.5 + 2.5 collection as close to the original Kingdom Hearts 2 Japanese release as possible. Stil a WIP. 
Biggest thigs that still need to be changed is move limit form to an FM area and skip the roxas fight in TWTNW. 
Not removing the FM areas so you can do those if you wish.
